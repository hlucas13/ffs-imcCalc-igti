# igti-ffs-IMCcalc

Simple exercise to demonstrate the use of JavaScript (HTML and CSS were not mandatory) done in the subject "Full Stack Development Fundamentals" offered for free by IGTI - Instituto de Gestão e Tecnologia da Informação (Institute of Management and Information Technology).

I made a simple website to calculate BMI (Body Mass Index) returning the result, the classification and what it may cause.
